## Fixed Issues

1. **Fixed Syntax Error in main.py**

    - Removed duplicate `if` statement at lines 652-653

2. **Dependency Issues**

    - Set up virtual environment to handle dependencies
    - Updated requirements.txt to remove invalid dependency (webbrowser)
    - Created setup_dependencies.py script for easy dependency management

3. **Run Environment**
    - Created launcher.py with virtual environment support
    - Created run.sh wrapper script for easy starting of the application
